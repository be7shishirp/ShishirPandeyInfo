Place your images inside an 'assets' folder with filenames:
profile.jpg, banner.jpg, father.jpg, mother.jpg, sister.jpg, brother.jpg, palpa.jpg, butwal.jpg, pic1.jpg, pic2.jpg, pic3.jpg

Open index.html in a browser. If you want exact Nepali (BS) live conversion, ask and I'll add a small JS library for that.
